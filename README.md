# Simulating predictions of classification models - Code for experiments
This repository contains the code to reproduce the computational experiments reported in the paper: ___Simulating predictions of classification models to evaluate predict-then-optimize methods___.

## Overview

The experiments are implemented in two Jupyter notebooks:
- `binary_experiments.ipynb`: Reproduces the results for binary classification settings.
- `multiclass_experiments.ipynb`: Reproduces the results for multiclass classification settings.

These notebooks generate the detailed computational results plotted in Figures 1â€“3 in the paper. 
Results are printed directly to the console for further processing.

Additionally, the file `siml.py` defines the core functions used to simulate predictions from classification models, which are used throughout both notebooks.

## Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following Python packages:
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- pandas
- numpy
